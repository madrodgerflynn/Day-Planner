I want to have empty rows from 9AM - 7PM

I am going to reference each row to allow for user input
The user will be able to fill in each section and then be able to save it
    this will be done by adding a text area within the rows

    I am going to have to use an event listener for a svae button 

    I am going to need to save to the local memory using a .setitem
